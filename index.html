                    <h2>as a computer science student</h2>
                    <p>
                         I chose this major because as a kid I really wanted to know how computers work,
                         I wanted to create games, websites, make new apps etc...<br>
                         I was never the top student in highschool, because I was so focused on the sport I choose,
                         now in college I am trying my best to be the best I can.
                         Choosing a career path that makes you want to get up every day and give your best,
                         was my goal, personally I think I did a great job choosing computer science as my profession,
                         it is tiring, it absoulutely requires a lot of work every day if you want to be a successful programmer,
                         but I love a hard challenge, personally I don't like things that are easy, or things that just go with the flow,
                         I love me a hard challenge every day
                    </p>

                    <h2>as a triathlete</h2>
                    <p>The real question is how I got myself doing this sport? I trained handball for about 4 years in middle school,
                     I got a knee injury and the doctors sent me to swim, for some kind of rehabilitation, after that I never thought of getting back to handball.
                     Like I said, I don't like things that are easy, training this sport professionally, as a teenager requires a lot of sacrifices, for an example I do 3 trainings a day
                     I follow a strict meal plan, so I can have the energy I need for the day, it requires a sleep schedule where every night you must get 8 hours of sleep, It requires a lot of discipline
                     a lot of time separated from friends and family, friday nights aren't for the disco, friday nights are for the gym.
                    </p>
                    <p>My word is it makes you become a disciplined human from early age
                     It makes you stronger, you win some races, you lose some, but everyday you go out and make the best training you can. That requires motivation, and a will for success. I got all this from triathlon,
                     I became a national champion 6 years in a row, I became the first woman in Macedonia to finish an Elite European cup, competing with one of the best triathletes in the world, I also became the first athlete
                     in Macedonia who was top 5 in the Balkan Championship. Triathlon has given me many memories, many life lessons, discipline, motivation and strength. Triathlon is a way of life.</p>
